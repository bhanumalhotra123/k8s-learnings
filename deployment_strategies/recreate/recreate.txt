Pros:
Application state entirely renewed

Cons: downtime that depends on both shutdown and boot duration of the application.

We see down time in this case. 

when we do kubectl apply -f app_v1.yml 
It deployes v1 with the service

Now when we do kubectl apply -f app_v2.yml

all the v1 pods goes down and then v2 comes up.
