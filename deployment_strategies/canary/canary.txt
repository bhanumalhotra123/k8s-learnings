Canary deployment 

Pros:
version is released for a subset of users
convinient for error rate and performance monitoring
fast rollback

Cons:
Slow rollout
fine tuned traffic distribution can be expensive


Say we have 5 replicas running, we for example create 1 of new and 4 of old.


Once version 2 is tested we delete pods of version1 and scale the other.


Service for both the version pods is same and sends requests to both.

kubectl apply -f app_v1.yml

kubectl scale --replicas=4 deployment my-app-v1

kubectl apply -f app_v2.yml

Once it is doing fine. We scale down the v1 and scale up v2.
