Old version(Green)
Newer Version(Blue)

Both are deployed at the same time.

Only 1 version of the application is accessible by the user 
other version is accessible to the QA environment by using direct port forwarding.

Once the new version is tested properly.
We scale it up
First we re-write the service to the newer version pods
We scale down the previous versions

Pros:
instant rollout/rollback(as we just need to direct the service)
avoid versioning issue, change the entire cluster state in one go


Cons:
requires double resources
proper testing should be done 
handling stateful applications can be hard



kubectl apply -f app_v1.yml
kubectl apply -f app_v2.yml

We create both the versions. v2 will be in testing. v1 will be give to the users.

Now say sign off is given to redirect from v1 to v2.

kubectl patch service my-app -p {"spec": {"selector":{"version":"v2.0.0"}}}

kubectl describe svc my-app
