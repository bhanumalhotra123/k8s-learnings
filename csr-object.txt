Create a CertificateSigningRequest object with the name akshay with the contents of the akshay.csr file


As of kubernetes 1.19, the API to use for CSR is certificates.k8s.io/v1.

Please note that an additional field called signerName should also be added when creating CSR. For client authentication to the API server we will use the built-in signer kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client.





Use this command to generate the base64 encoded format as following: -

cat akshay.csr | base64 -w 0


Finally, save the below YAML in a file and create a CSR name akshay as follows: -

---
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: akshay
spec:
  groups:
  - system:authenticated 
  request: <Paste the base64 encoded value of the CSR file>
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  usages:
  - client auth


kubectl apply -f akshay-csr.yaml
